# Books_exercises

Welcome to my **Books_exercises** repository! This is where I practice coding exercises inspired by two excellent textbooks:

1. *Big Java* by Cay Horstmann
2. *Java™ Programming: From Problem Analysis to Program Design* by D.S. Malik

## Overview
In this repository, you'll find:
- Exercises that focus on methods and object-oriented programming (OOP).
- Solutions to problems related to data structures like arrays.
- Code snippets and programs designed to strengthen my programming fundamentals.

## Structure
The repository is organized by topic and exercise type. Each folder contains:
- Exercise implementations.
- Notes or explanations where applicable.


## Purpose
This repository serves as my personal practice space to:
- Enhance my understanding of programming concepts.
- Apply principles of OOP and problem analysis.
- Build a solid foundation in handling arrays and other basic data structures.

## Notes
These exercises are primarily for my learning journey, but feel free to explore the repository. If you find something interesting or have suggestions, I’d love to hear from you!

Thank you for stopping by!
