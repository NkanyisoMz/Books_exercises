/*
(The Power Station Problem) A power station is on one side of a river
that is one-half miles wide, and a factory is 8 miles downstream on the other
side of the river (see Figure 7-18). It costs $7 per foot to run power lines
overland and $9 per foot to run them underwater. Your objective is to
determine the most economical path to lay the power line. That is,
determine how long the power line should run underwater and how long
it should run over land, to achieve the minimum total cost of laying the
power line.

Write a program that prompts the user to enter the following:
a. The width of the river.
b. The distance of the factory downstream on the other side of the river.
c. Cost of laying the power line underwater.
d. Cost of laying the power line overland.
The program then outputs the length of the power line that should run
underwater and the length that should run over land, so the cost of constructing
the power line is at the minimum. The program should also output the total
cost of constructing the power line.
