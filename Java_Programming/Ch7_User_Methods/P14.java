/*
When you borrow money to buy a house, a car, or for some other purpose,
then you typically repay it by making periodic payments. Suppose that the
loan amount is L, r is the interest rate per year, m is the number of payments
in a year, and the loan is for t years. Suppose that i Â¼ (r / m) and r is in
decimal. Then the periodic payment is:

R= Li/1-(1+i)^-(mt)

You can also calculate the unpaid loan balance after making certain payments.
For example, the unpaid balance after making k payments is:

L' = R[(1-(1+i)^(mt-k))/i]

where R is the periodic payment. (Note that if the payments are monthly,
then m = 12.
