/*
Write a program that takes as input five numbers and outputs the mean
(average) and standard deviation of the numbers. If the numbers are x1, x2,
x3, x4, and x5, then the mean is x Â¼ (x1 + x2 + x3+ x4 + x5) / 5 and the
standard deviation is:

s = sqrt(((x1-x)^2 + (x2-x)^2 + (x3-x)^2 + (x4-x)^2 + (x5-x)^2)/5)

Your program must contain at least the following method: A method that
calculates and returns the mean and a method that calculates the standard
deviation.
