/*
(The box problem) You have been given a flat cardboard of area, say,
70 square inches, to make an open box by cutting a square from each
corner and folding the sides (see Figure 7-17). Your objective is to
determine the dimension, that is, the length and width, and the side of
the square to be cut from the corners so that the resulting box is of
maximum volume.

Write a program that prompts the user to enter the area of the flat cardboard. 
The program then outputs the length and width of the cardboard and the length of the
side of the square to be cut from the corner so that theresulting box is of maximum volume. 
Calculate your answer to three decimal places. Your program must contain a method that takes as input
the length and width of the cardboard and returns the side of the square that
should be cut to maximize the volume. The method also returns the maximum volume.
