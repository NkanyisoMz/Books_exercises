/*
a. Write the definition of method one so that it returns the sum of
x and y if x is greater than y; otherwise, it should return x minus 2
times y.

b. Write the definition of method two as follows:
    i. Read a number and store it in z.
    ii. Update the value of z by adding the value of a to its previous value.
    iii. Assign the variable first the value returned by method one with
    the parameters 6 and 8.
    iv. Update the value of first by adding the value of x to its previous
    value.
    v. If the value of z is more than twice the value of first, return z;
    otherwise, return 2 times first minus z.

c. Write a Java program that tests parts a and b. (Declare additional variables in the method main, if necessary.)
