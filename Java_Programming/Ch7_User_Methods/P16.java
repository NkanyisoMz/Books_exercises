/*
Write a program that reads a student’s name together with his or her test
scores. The program should then compute the average test score for
each student and assign the appropriate grade. The grade scale is as follows:
90-100,A; 80-89,B; 70-79,C;60-69,D; 0-59,F.
Your program must use the following methods:
    a. A value-returning method, calculateAverage, to determine and
    return the average of five test scores for each student. Use a loop to
    read and sum the five test scores. (This method does not output the
    average test score. That task must be done in the method main.)
    b. A value-returning method, calculateGrade, to determine and return
    each student’s grade. (This method does not output the grade. That task
    must be done in the method main.

Test your program on the following data. Read the data from a file and send
the output to a file. Do not use any global variables. Use the appropriate
parameters to pass values in and out of methods.
