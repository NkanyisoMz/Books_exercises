/*
(Pipe Problem, requires trigonometry) A pipe is to be carried around
the right-angled corner of two intersecting corridors. Suppose that the
widths of the two intersecting corridors are 5 feet and 8 feet (see Figure 7-19).
Your objective is to find the length of the longest pipe, rounded to the nearest
foot, that can be carried level around the right-angled corner.

Write a program that prompts the user to input the widths of both the
hallways. The program then outputs the length of the longest pipe, rounded
to the nearest foot, that can be carried level around the right-angled corner.
(Note that the length of the pipe is given by l = AB + BC = 8 / sin theta +5/
cos theta, where 0 < theta < pi/2.)
