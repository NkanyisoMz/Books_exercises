// a. Example 8-7 defined the class Person to store the name of a person.
// The methods that we included merely set the name and print the name
// of a person. Redefine the class Person so that, in addition to what the
// existing class does, you can:
// i. Set the last name only.
// ii. Set the first name only.
// iii. Set the middle name.
// iv. Check whether a given last name is the same as the last name of this
// person.
// v. Check whether a given first name is the same as the first name of
// this person.
// vi. Check whether a given middle name is the same as the middle
// name of this person.
// b. Add the method equals that returns true if two objects contain the
// same first, middle, and last name.
// c. Add the method makeCopy that copies the instance variables of a
// Person object into another Person object.
// d. Add the method getCopy that creates and returns the address of the
// object, which is a copy of another Person object.
// e. Add the copy constructor.
// f. Write the definitions of the methods of the class Person to implement
// the operations for this class.
// g. Write a program that tests various operations of the class Person.
