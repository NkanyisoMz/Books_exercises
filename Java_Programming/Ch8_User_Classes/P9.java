//  Rational fractions are of the form a / b, where a and b are integers and b 6¼ 0.
// In this exercise, by ‘‘fractions’’ we mean rational fractions. Suppose that a / b and
// c / d are fractions. Arithmetic operations on fractions are defined by the following
// rules:
// a / b + c / d = (ad + bc) / bd
// a / b – c / d = (ad – bc) / bd
// a / b x c / d = ac / bd
// (a / b)/(c / d) = ad / bc, where c / d 6¼ 0
// Fractions are compared as follows: a / b op c / d if ad op bc, where op is any of
// the relational operations. For example, a / b < c / d if ad < bc.
// Design the class Fraction that can be used to manipulate fractions in a
// program. Among others, the class Fraction must include methods to add,
// subtract, multiply, and divide fractions. When you add, subtract, multiply, or
// divide fractions, your answer need not be in the lowest terms. Also, override the
// method toString so that the fractions can be output using the output statement.
// Write a Java program that, using the class Fraction, performs operations on
// fractions
