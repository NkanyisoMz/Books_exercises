// a. Some of the characteristics of a book are the title, author(s), publisher,
// ISBN, price, and year of publication. Design the class Book that
// defines the book as an ADT.
// Each object of the class Book can hold the following information
// about a book: title, up to four authors, publisher, ISBN, price, year of
// publication, and number of copies in stock. To keep track of the number
// of authors, add another instance variable.
// Include the methods to perform various operations on the objects of
// Book. For example, the usual operations that can be performed on the title
// are to show the title, set the title, and check whether a title is the actual title
// of the book. Similarly, the typical operations that can be performed on the
// number of copies in stock are to show the number of copies in stock, set the
// number of copies in stock, update the number of copies in stock, and return
// the number of copies in stock. Add similar operations for the publisher,
// ISBN, book price, and authors. Add the appropriate constructors.
// b. Write the definitions of the methods of the class Book.
// c. Write a program that uses the class Book and tests various operations
// on the objects of class Book.
