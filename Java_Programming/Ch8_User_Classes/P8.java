//  The equation of a line in standard form is ax + by ¼ c, where a and b both
// cannot be zero, and a, b, and c are real numbers. If b 6¼ 0, then –a / b is the
// slope of the line. If a ¼ 0, then it is a horizontal line, and if b ¼ 0, then it is a
// vertical line. The slope of a vertical line is undefined. Two lines are parallel if
// they have the same slope or both are vertical lines. Two lines are perpendicular if one of the lines is horizontal and another is vertical, or if the product
// of their slopes is –1. Design the class lineType to store a line. To store a
// line, you need to store the values of a (coefficient of x), b (coefficient of y),
// and c. Your class must contain the following operations:
// a. If a line is nonvertical, then determine its slope.
// b. Determine if two lines are equal. (Two lines a1x + b1y ¼ c1 and a2x + b2y ¼ c2
// are equal if either a1 ¼ a2, b1 ¼ b2, and c1 ¼ c2 or a1 ¼ ka2, b1 ¼ kb2, and
// c1 ¼ kc2 for some real number k.
// c. Determine if two lines are parallel.
// d. Determine if two lines are perpendicular.
// e. If two lines are not parallel, then find the point of intersection.
// Add appropriate constructors to initialize variables of lineType. Also write
// a program to test your class.
