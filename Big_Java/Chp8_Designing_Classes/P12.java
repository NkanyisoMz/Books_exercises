//  Write methods 
// public static double angle(Point2D.Double p, Point2D.Double q)
// public static double slope(Point2D.Double p, Point2D.Double q)
// that compute the angle between the x-axis and the line joining two points,
//  measured in degrees, and the slope of that line. 
// Add the methods to the class Geometry. Supply suitable preconditions.
// Why does it make sense to use a static method in this case?
