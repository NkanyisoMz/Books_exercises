//  Using the Picture class from Worked Example 6.2, write a method
// public static Picture greenScreen(Picture pic1, Picture pic2)
// that superimposes two pictures, yielding a picture whose width and 
// height are the larger of the widths and heights of pic1 and pic2. 
// In the area where both pictures have pixels, use pic1, 
// except when its pixels are green, in which case, you use pic2.
