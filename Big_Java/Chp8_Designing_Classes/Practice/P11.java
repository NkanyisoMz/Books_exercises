//  Write methods 
// public static double perimeter(Ellipse2D.Double e); 
// public static double area(Ellipse2D.Double e); 
// that compute the area and the perimeter of the ellipse e. 
// Add these methods to a class Geometry. 
// The challenging part of this assignment is to find and implement an accurate
// formula for the perimeter. 
// Why does it make sense to use a static method in this case?
