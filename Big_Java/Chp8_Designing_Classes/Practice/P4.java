//  As pointed out in Section 8.2.3, the Scanner.next method is a mutator 
//  that returns a value. Implement a class Reader that reads from System.in 
//  and does not suffer from that shortcoming. Provide methods
// public boolean hasMoreElements() // Checks whether there is another element
// public String getCurrent() // Yields the current element without consuming it
// public void next() // Consumes the current element
