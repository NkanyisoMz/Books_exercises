//  Implement a class LoginForm that simulates a login form that you find on many web 
// pages. Supply methods
// public void input(String text)
// public void click(String button)
// public boolean loggedIn()
// The first input is the user name, the second input is the password. The click method 
// can be called with arguments "Submit" and "Reset". Once a user has been successfully 
// logged in, by supplying the user name, password, and clicking on the submit button, 
// the loggedIn method returns true and further input has no effect. When a user tries to 
// log in with an invalid user name and password, the form is reset.
// Supply a constructor with the expected user name and password
