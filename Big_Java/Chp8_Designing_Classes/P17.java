//  Consider the following algorithm for computing x^n for an integer n. 
//If n < 0, x^n is 1/x^–n. If n is positive and even, then x^n = (x^n/
// 2 )^2. If n is positive and odd, then 
// x^n = x^(n–1) × x. Implement a static method double 
//intPower(double x, int n) that uses this algorithm. 
//Add it to a class called Numeric.
